# LSTM_AND_RNN_ON_AIR_QUALITY_INDEX

The dataset dealt with air quality measurememts and it included different 
kind of concentrations and factors affecting it. A few features are CO(GT), 
C6H6(GT) and PT08.S4(NO2). The data is sequential and is not supposed to 
be shuffled. I was asked to take PT08.S4(NO2) as my target label. These 
kinds of datasets are suitable for time series analysis.
